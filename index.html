    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>Unlike apps available on the Play Store or App Store, Daman Games requires you to download the app directly from their official website. Here is how you can do it safely:
Step 1: Visit the Official Website
First, use your browser to visit the official Daman Games website. Always ensure you are using the real website to avoid downloading from unofficial or risky sources.
Step 2: Click on the Download Button
On the homepage, you will see a download button that usually mentions downloading the APK file for Android users. Click on it.
Step 3: Allow APK Downloads
Your phone might warn you about installing apps from unknown sources. This is normal for APK files. Go to your settings and allow downloads from your browser just for this time.
Step 4: Install the Daman Games App
Once the file is downloaded, open it and proceed with the installation steps. The app will be ready to use within a minute or two.
Step 5: Login or Register
After installing, open the app. You can either log in if you already have an account or create a new account if you are new to Daman Games.
